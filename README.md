# stock-project-flask
The API I used for this project is Yahoo Finance 

The site can be reached from the following URL:
https://stock-project-flask.herokuapp.com/

The website primarily is for searching all stock symbols in the NYSE and AMEX stock exchanges. It displays some data that might be important for someone researching the stock.

The home page displays genereal market news, with a link to the original article.
A major component of this site is also the chart. I used MATPLOTLIB for this.
The features I implemented are a search from navbar that displays on every page.
Register, Login, and Logout were also implemented using WTForms, and SQLalchemy.
Registgered users can save, add and delete stocks to a watchlist and check their daily performance.

The technology stack used is Python, Flask and SQLalchemy
